## Description of the new feature
There's not much to describe. Basically, the particles that appear when breaking blocks are disturbing and noisy, especially when insta-mining blocks. If you would be so kind to add a toggle in Optifine that prevents these particles from showing, it would be greatly appreciated!

PS: It's my first time doing a feature request on Github, so I hope I'm doing it right.
